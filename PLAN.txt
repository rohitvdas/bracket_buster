BRACKET BUSTER - a March Madness Breakout variant in which a player must move a platform horizontally across the bottom
of the screen to throw/catch a basketball towards blocks in an effort to score a certain number of points within a given
time frame. If the ball passes the bottom of the screen, a life is subtracted from the player's total number of lives.
While the required score, allotted time, and starting number of lives remain the same throughout the levels, the block
makeup will vary across levels to affect difficulty. This is interesting because basketball is a game that most Duke
students (and college students in general) can easily relate to, allowing them to quickly understand the rules and
hopefully become more excited about playing the game.

Levels:
-Sweet Sixteen
-Elite Eight
-Final Four
-National Championship
Difficulty increases as player progresses through the levels i.e. fewer 2 + 3 pointers and power ups, more fouls and
bricks at higher levels

Blocks:
-Free throw: +1 point
-2 pointer: +2 points
-3 pointer: +3 points
-Foul: -1 point
-Brick: ball falls straight down instead of bouncing

Power ups (randomly fall from a broken block):
-And 1: +1 point
-Rebound: +1 life
-Steal: add time to clock

Cheat keys:
-Home court advantage: press a key to add points
-5 star recruit: press a key to freeze/unfreeze time
-Coach K: press a key to automatically progress to the next level

Extra addition:
Ability to play as different "positions", affecting both the size/speed of the platform and the speed of the ball. This
is a substantial addition because it allows for greater flexibility in player strategy, thus increasing engagement and
giving the game lasting appeal.
